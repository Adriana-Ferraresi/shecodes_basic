      1/2 cup water <br>
      01 pinch of salt <br>

      Once the dough has rested, stir the mixture <br>

      Don't forget that the bottom of the couscous bowl has to contain water <br>
      Cover and place over low heat for approximately 8 minutes <br>
      Or until the couscous starts to give off a whiff of corn <br>
      <br />

      <strong>Couscous soaked in milk</strong> <br>
      When the couscous comes off the heat, place it in a bowl <br>
      Pour the hot milk over the top until the couscous is submerged <br>
      Cover and let it sit until the couscous absorbs the milk, it's wonderful! <br>
      <br />
